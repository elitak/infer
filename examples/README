This directory contains example data files and a GNUmakefile
infrastructure for running the inference system on the examples.

For each data file "test" in the directory data, you can say:

  examples >gmake test-learn

The system will create a directory named "test" in the directory
results.  That directory will contain the generated PADS description
and supporting files.  If you change into that directory, you can make
generated tools by invoking:

 examples/results/test>gmake test-accum
 examples/results/test>gmake test-xml
 examples/results/test>gmake test-fmt

The compiler will put the generated executables into an architecture
specific directory underneath the "test" directory.  You can then
invoke any of these tools as follows, where "darwin.i386" is replaced
by a string dependent upon your architecture:

 >cd examples/results/test
 >darwin.i386/test-accum ../../data/test

with the output appearing on standard out and standard error.
