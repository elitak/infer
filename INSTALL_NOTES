There is a bug in smlnj-110.65 (fixed in later versions) in the eof
function generated by the lexer.  This bug manifests itself in
inferred PADS descriptions that have parsing errors.  If you encounter
this bug, you can patch the generated files

  $(LEARN_HOME)/src/vanilla.lex.sml
  $(LEARN_HOME)/src/tokens.lex.sml

by replacing the line

      fun eof (Stream {strm, ...}) = TSIO.endOfStream strm 

with the line

        fun eof s = not (isSome(getc s))
