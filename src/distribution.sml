     *              format, with a uniform distribution. Very similar
     *              to uniform star.
     * Frequency:   Use the frequency of the observed data of a (usually
     *              small sample space. The map from ordinal to frequency
     *              is represented as a list of integers

       1. ReStar: For a regular expression with a star (no limit to the
                  length, e.g string). For now we will use the max length
                  of the observed data to reduce this to case 2.
